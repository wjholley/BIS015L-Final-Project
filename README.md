# BIS015L-Final-Project

A final project made by three people:

William Holley -  wjholley@ucdavis.edu
Guanzhi Wang - agwang@ucdavis.edu
Luc-Tanton Tran - lqtran@ucdavis.edu

Will (eventually) become a project that analyzes some data about birds getting malaria.
Who knew birds could get malaria? Not the authors, before we found these data.

Enjoy, or whatever
